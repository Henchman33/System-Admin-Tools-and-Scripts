Use the GUI for GUI purposes :-D

The other file you can run in ISE and edit the Source and Destinations you want, it gives a progress bar as well and createss a folder on c:\logs and  makes a log file of the copy.

This works for network locations as well, just type in the UNC path to where you want it to go to "Example: e:\folder as Source and Destination \\networkdevicename\d$\folder_you_want_it_copied_to "backup" or whatever you choose.

Enjoy!
